Job Schedule Datasets Summary (Jobs with Sequential Tasks)
============================================================

SMALL Dataset (small_dataset.csv):
- Machines: 2-5 (random)
- Jobs: 3-5 (random)
- Tasks per job: 2-5 (random)
- Task execution time range: 5-60 minutes

MEDIUM Dataset (medium_dataset.csv):
- Machines: 5-12 (random)
- Jobs: 8-20 (random)
- Tasks per job: 2-8 (random)
- Task execution time range: 5-60 minutes

LARGE Dataset (large_dataset.csv):
- Machines: 10-20 (random)
- Jobs: 20-50 (random)
- Tasks per job: 2-10 (random)
- Task execution time range: 5-60 minutes

CSV Format:
- job_id: Identifier of the job this task belongs to
- task_id: Unique identifier for each task
- execution_time: Time required to complete the task (minutes)
- machines_count: Total number of machines available

Task Dependencies:
- Tasks within a job are sequentially dependent (implied by task_id ordering)
- First task of each job has no dependencies (independent)
- Jobs are independent of each other
